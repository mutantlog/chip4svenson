Code for my Twitter bot http://twitter.com/chip4svenson to campaign for Chip Zdarsky to play Mr Svenson on Riverdale

I mean, this is really a dumb idea. There's a directory of images of Svenson, and a directory of images of Chip. It picks one at random from each of them, picks a phrase at random, and tweets it. Uh, that's it.
